# TSP-Genetic-Algorithms
This project was develop with the objective of solving the Travelling salesman problem as a Genetic Algorithm. 
Edge Recombination was introduced as a specialized operator for TSP. 
The motivation behind this operator is that it should preserve the adjacency between permutation elements, since the cost of a tour in a TSP is directly related to the set of adjacency relationships that exist s between permutation elements.
